# Step 06

The plan:

Weâ€™re going to add a Cursor object which represents a location in the table

Things you might want to do with cursors:

- Create a cursor at the beginning of the table
- Create a cursor at the end of the table
- Access the row the cursor is pointing to
- Advance the cursor to the next row
