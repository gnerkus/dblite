# Step 13

## History

## Plan
When a leaf node splits due to the addition of a key, we will:
1. Update the first key in the parent to be the maximum key in the left child
2. Add a new child pointer / key pair after the updated key
   1. The new pointer points to the new child node
   2. The new key is the maximum key in the new child node
